# Recap async await

We are going to practice fetching data, manipulating data, and creating search and filter functionality.

## External tools

We are going to use

- [Dummy json API](https://dummyjson.com/)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons/cart-shopping?s=solid&f=classic)

## Run the project

1. Go into the HTML file
2. press on "go live" (you need to install the extension Live Server)

## What to do

This is a recap course, so the instructor will show you how it is done.
But, if you want to try on your own, try to achieve these goals, using the external API.

## Goals

### 1. Show all

Fetch and present all products on the main page.

### 2. Move to Cart

Pressing on "to cart" will move the item to cart.

### 3. Build cart

Pressing on the cart button (in the navbar) should change from all products to the products in the cart.

### 4. Search

Add the search functionality to the search input in the navbar. Searching should filter to show only the relevant products by name.

### BONUS: What ever you heart desire

The possibilities are endless!

Add filters, add catergories (you can fetch by catageroy!), add more complex search capabilites and many more!
